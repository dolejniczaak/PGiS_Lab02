In London, they ride on the Underground, walking down an ordinary street, until they reach a pub called the Leaky Cauldron, which Hagrid says is famous. Harry notes that, apart from Hagrid, nobody else even seems to notice it. Hagrid takes them inside. The barman seems to know Hagrid, and offers him his usual, but Hagrid says he's on official business. The barman, Tom, and the rest of the clientele notice Harry and know instantly who he is.
One of the people in the pub is Professor Quirrell, who Hagrid introduces to Harry. He will be teaching Defense Against The Dark Arts at Hogwarts, and is there to pick up a new book on vampires. He is nervous and twitchy. Hagrid eventually separates Harry from the crowd and takes him into the back courtyard. Hagrid says that Quirrell had a brilliant mind, but his actual experiences with monsters seem to have affected him, and now he's scared of his own subject. He counts bricks in the back wall of the courtyard and taps the wall with his umbrella, and it soon opens up into an archway onto Diagon Alley.
